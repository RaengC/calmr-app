## Technical Tasks and User Stories

Looking for respite from stress or anxiousness weâ€™ve designed a website with limited choice and accessibility in mind which provides visual resources to aid in calming the mind. Resources accessible through interacting with a chatbot or a podcast search feature.

Collaborators [Brittany Crocker](https://github.com/brittanylcrocker) , [Giti Mafakheri](https://github.com/Giti-mafakheri), [Henry Zhang](https://github.com/lightgreener) and Raeng Castagna.
